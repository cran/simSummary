Package: simSummary
Title: Simulation summary
Description: simSummary is a small utility package which eases the
        process of summarizing simulation results. Simulations often
        produce intermediate results - some focal statistics that need
        to be summarized over several scenarios and many replications.
        This step is in principle easy, but tedious. The package
        simSummary fills this niche by providing a generic way of
        summarizing the focal statistics of simulations. The useR must
        provide properly structured input, holding focal statistics,
        and then the summary step can be performed with one line of
        code, calling the simSummary function.
